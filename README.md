# rockPaperScissors - simple RPS game using Javascript & HTML
Simple Rock Paper Scissors exercise that I can launch in browser, using basic Javascript & HTML.

1st Commit - HTML form with headers and buttons for each element of rock, paper & scissors.

2nd Commit - Picking up each button element from the HTML document by defining them as constants in the app.js file. Could have given them class names but only 3 buttons needed (rock, paper, scissors) for this basic app so can pick up each element using 'geElementById' then to iterate through them using a forEach loop & an event listener within the loop. When launched each element (Rock, Paper or Scissors) appears as the userChoice (next to - Your Choice:) in the browser.
